\section{Introduction}
This proof will show that for a $2 \times 2$ system, the only matrix polynomial possible is when the eigenvalue is a polynomial in $k$ (or $\lambda$ depending on source) itself.

\section{Same Eigenvalue}
It is apparent that the eigenvalues of a non-diagonalizable $2 \times 2$ matrix must because if there are 2 Jordan Blocks of dimension 1, the matrix would be diagonalizable which is against our assumption for the proof.

Thus, there is one Jordan Block of dimension 1, and since all diagonal elements of a Jordan Block have the same eigenvalue, the Matrix Polynomial to be determined must have the same eigenvalue.

\section{Proof}
Let $\Lambda$ be a matrix polynomial in $k$, $P$ be the similarity transformation and $J$ be the matrix expressed in Jordan Normal Form, such that
$$\Lambda = PJP^{-1}.$$
The right hand side can be represented as
$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    a & b \\
    c & d
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    \Omega & 1 \\
    0 & \Omega
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    a & b \\
    c & d
\end{array}\right)^{-1}.$$
Multiplying the matrices gives us a general expression for $\Lambda$ as 
$$\Lambda = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
    \Omega - \frac{ac}{ad-bc} & a^2 \\
    -c^2 & \Omega + \frac{ac}{ad-bc}
\end{array}\right).$$
However, since $\Lambda$ is also a matrix polynomial, we must have that
$$\Lambda = \sum_{i=0}^{n} k^i A_i$$
where $A_i$ refers to a matrix with complex entries.

Substituting $X$ for $\frac{ac}{ad-bc}$, equating the two expressions and considering the diagonal entries only, we get the following system of equations.
\begin{align*}
    \Omega - X = \sum_{i=0}^{n}\alpha_ik^i \\
    \Omega + X = \sum_{i=0}^{n}\beta_ik^i.
\end{align*}
Solving for $\Omega$, we get that
$$\Omega = \sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{(\alpha_i - \beta_i)}{2}k^i.$$

\section{Conclusion}
From this, we learn that using the Unified Transform Method for a $2 \times 2$ System of PDEs with a non-diagonalizable matrix-valued polynomial reduces to the general case when its eigenvalue is a polynomial itself.
