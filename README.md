#Unified Transform Method for Systems of Non-Diagonalizable Differential Operators
In the Summer of 2021, I worked as part of the Unified Transform Lab towards extending the Fokas Method for Solving Systems of PDEs to cases with a non-diagonalizable differential operator.

## Progress Overview
I learned about the Fokas Method of solving PDEs and applied it to many examples in the scalar case. 
By referencing to [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00358) research paper by Deconick et. al., I extended this to the case in which the differential operator is non-diagonalizable.

It followed a [proof](/2x2Proof.tex) by me, stating that the only type of non-diagonalizable matrix possible in the 2x2 case is the one outlined in the report. (2x2Proof.tex)

The report outlining the Fokas Method with a non-diagonalizable differential operator for the 2x2 system case is given [here](/UTM-Nondiagonalizable-2x2.tex). (UTM-Nondiagonalizable-2x2.tex)

The notes overviewing the use of the Jordan Canonical Form in exponentiating non-diagonalizable matrices is given [here](/JordanNormalNotes.tex) and uses the fact that the Jordan Normal Form is the addition of a diagonal matrix with a nilpotent matrix. (JordanNormalNotes.tex)
